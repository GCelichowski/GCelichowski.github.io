# Gavin Celichowski's Personal Homepage
## Site Architecture:
### Frontend: [Web Page Template and Design](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/)
### Page Hosting: This page is hosted for free on GitHub. If you'd like to have similar hosting for your own site, use the following steps:
* Login to your GitHub account (or create one)
* Create a repository named *GitHubUsername*.github.io
* Create and push an HTML file called ```index.html```
	* This will be the "Home Page" of your site
### Blog Backend
* Articles are stored in [Cloud Service]
* Web page side JavaScript is used to pull the articles and dynamically display them

*Some HTML/CSS/JavaScript experience will be necessary to customize the site from the template*
